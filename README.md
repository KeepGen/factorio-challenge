### 🧠 Why Factorio?
Besides being an excellent game, Factorio is surprisingly relevant to software engineers.

It naturally trains skills like:

- Systems thinking
- Scalability & bottleneck analysis
- Automation mindset
- Debugging & optimization
- Long-term architectural planning

Many developers consider it one of the most "programmer-like" games ever made.

If you're curious, there is plenty of discussion about this online.
